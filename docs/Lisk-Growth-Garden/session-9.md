**By:** ETH JKT
**Date:** December 3, 2025

Wrap up by learning how to take your DApp idea from a hackathon project to a venture-ready product. Explore pitching, and what it means to build in Ethereum's infinite garden.

---

## 🎯 Today's Mission

**What separates good hackathon projects from great ones?**

Using **Memora** (ETHGlobal Singapore 2024 Finalist) as our case study

---

## ❌ What Makes a BAD Hackathon Project

**Common Pitfalls:**

**1. "Just Another DeFi Fork"**
- No differentiation or innovation
- Copying existing solutions
- No real problem being solved

**2. Ambitious Vision, Poor Execution**
- Grand vision but can't demo the core value
- All promises, no proof
- "Trust us, it'll be amazing" - but nothing works

**3. Tech Stack Resume Padding**
- Using 15 sponsors' tech just for prizes
- Forced integrations that don't make sense
- Complexity without purpose

**4. No Clear User**
- "Everyone can use this!"
- Abstract problem nobody actually has
- Can't explain who benefits

---

## ✅ What Makes a GOOD Hackathon Project

**The Winning Formula:**

1. **Real Problem, Real Users**
2. **Ambitious Vision + Smooth Delivery**
3. **Clear Value Proposition**
4. **Smart Tech Stack Choices**
5. **Compelling Story**

---

## 1️⃣ Real Problem, Real Users

**Bad Example:**
"A marketplace for trading tokenized thoughts"

**Good Example - Memora:**
*"2.8B social media accounts belong to deceased users. Families can't access them. Digital memories are lost forever."*

**Why it works:**
- ✅ Specific, measurable problem
- ✅ Everyone knows someone affected
- ✅ Emotional resonance
- ✅ Clear gap in existing solutions

**Finding Your Problem:**
- Have I experienced this pain personally?
- Can I name 10 people who need this?
- Does this cost people time/money/stress?
- Why hasn't this been solved yet?

---

## 2️⃣ Ambitious Vision + Smooth Delivery

**The Reality:** Big ideas are GREAT - but you need proof of concept

**Bad Approach:**
"We're building everything!" → Nothing works end-to-end

**Good Approach - Memora:**
- **Big Vision:** Complete digital legacy platform
- **What They Built:** Core flow working smoothly
  - ✅ Mint a time capsule NFT
  - ✅ AI monitors for life events
  - ✅ Auto-unlock works on testnet
  - 📋 Full platform in roadmap

**The Difference? They delivered the CORE VALUE PROP**

---

## 🎯 The "Smooth Delivery" Formula

**You CAN be ambitious if:**

✅ **Core user journey is bulletproof**
- Practice demo 10 times
- Every click works perfectly
- No "imagine this part works"

✅ **You articulate scope clearly**
- "Today we've built X"
- "Next we'll add Y and Z"
- "Ultimate vision is..."

✅ **Each piece is polished**
- Better 3 features working perfectly
- Than 10 features half-broken

✅ **Your pitch explains the journey**
- "This is step 1 of our vision"
- "Here's how we validate the concept"
- "Here's the path forward"

---

## 3️⃣ Clear Value Proposition

**The 1-Sentence Test:**

❌ "We use blockchain and AI for digital stuff"

✅ **"Memora lets you create blockchain time capsules that automatically unlock when life events happen"**

**Why It Works:**
- Clear action (create time capsules)
- Clear trigger (life events)
- Clear benefit (automatic)
- Clear tech (blockchain)

**Formula:**
*[Platform] helps [user] do [action] through [unique method]*

---

## 4️⃣ Smart Tech Stack Choices

**Bad:** "Let's use all 20 sponsor technologies!"

**Good - Memora's Stack:**
- **Rootstock** → Core blockchain infrastructure
- **Gaia Net AI** → Unique event monitoring differentiator
- **Worldcoin** → Solves real human verification need
- **Dynamic** → Makes it actually usable (UX)

**Each tech serves a PURPOSE, not just sponsorship points**

---

## 🔧 Choosing Your Stack

**Questions for Each Technology:**

1. **Does this solve a core problem?**
   - Not: "Sponsor X is offering prizes"
   - Yes: "We need oracles for off-chain data"

2. **Can we implement it in 48 hours?**
   - Be realistic about complexity
   - Test integrations beforehand

3. **Can we demo it clearly?**
   - Judges need to SEE it working
   - Invisible tech doesn't score points

4. **Does it strengthen our story?**
   - ✅ "AI monitors life events automatically"
   - ❌ "We integrated 12 APIs"

---

## 5️⃣ Compelling Story

**Every Great Hack Has a Narrative Arc**

**Memora's Story:**
1. **Hook:** "What happens to your digital life after you die?"
2. **Problem:** Current solutions are manual, insecure, incomplete
3. **Solution:** Blockchain + AI automation
4. **Demo:** Watch it work live
5. **Vision:** Preserve digital legacies for generations

**Judges remember stories, not feature lists**

---

## 📖 Story Structure

**Opening Hook (30 sec):**
- Start with emotion or surprise
- Make it personal or universal
- "Did you know..." or "Imagine if..."

**Problem Setup (1 min):**
- Paint the pain clearly
- Use numbers or examples
- Show you understand the space

**Your Solution (2 min):**
- How it works simply
- Live demo is KEY
- Why THIS approach

**The Vision (30 sec):**
- Where this could go
- Impact at scale
- Leave them inspired

## ⚠️ The Reality Check

### Winning a Hackathon ≠ Having a Startup

**What You Have:**
- Working prototype
- Cool demo
- Judge validation
- Community buzz

**What Investors Need:**
- Real users with real problems
- Clear path to revenue
- Defensible advantage
- Team that can execute

*The gap between these is where most projects die.*

---

## 🏗️ Making Your Project Venture-Ready

### 4 Critical Steps:

1. Validate Real Demand
2. Define Your Business Model
3. Build Your Moat
4. Assemble the Right Team

---

## 1️⃣ Validate Real Demand

### Hackathon judges liked it. Will users pay for it?

**Bad Sign:**
- "Everyone at the hackathon loved it!"
- Only crypto people understand it
- No one outside ETH community cares

**Good Sign - Memora:**
- Estate lawyers asking "when can I use this?"
- Non-crypto users saying "I need this"
- People sharing personal stories about lost accounts
- Inbound interest after demo

---

### 🔍 How to Validate

**Week 1-2: Talk to 20+ Potential Users**

Ask:
- "Have you experienced this problem?"
- "How do you solve it today?"
- "Would you pay for a solution?"
- "How much would you pay?"

**Red Flags:**
- "That's interesting..." (polite rejection)
- "Maybe someday I'd use it"
- They can't articulate the pain

**Green Flags:**
- "When can I sign up?"
- "Here's my credit card"
- They share the problem with others
- They have workarounds that suck

---

## 2️⃣ Define Your Business Model

### How will you actually make money?

**Hackathon Answer:** "We'll figure that out later"

**Investor Answer:** "Here are 3 revenue streams we've validated"

---

### 💰 Example: Memora's Business Model

**Revenue Stream 1: Freemium SaaS**
- Free: 1 time capsule, basic features
- Pro: $9.99/month - unlimited capsules, advanced AI monitoring
- Target: 10,000 users → $100K MRR in 12 months

**Revenue Stream 2: B2B Enterprise**
- White-label for estate lawyers
- $499/month per practice
- Target: 50 practices → $25K MRR in 18 months

**Revenue Stream 3: Transaction Fees**
- 3% on NFT mints and transfers
- 5% on premium unlocks

**Total Addressable Market:** $4B+ digital estate planning by 2028

---

### 🎯 Building Your Business Model

**Questions to Answer:**
1. Who pays? (End user? Business? Both?)
2. Why do they pay? (What's the value?)
3. How much? (Pricing validated by users)
4. When? (Subscription? One-time? Transaction?)
5. What's your CAC vs LTV? (Unit economics)

**Formula:** If acquiring a customer costs $50, they need to generate $150+ lifetime value

*Test pricing BEFORE building more features*

---

## 3️⃣ Build Your Moat

### What stops someone from copying you in 2 weeks?

**Weak Moats:**
- "We're first" (not defensible)
- "Our tech is complex" (can be replicated)
- "We have a patent" (expensive, slow, often useless)

**Strong Moats:**
- Network effects
- Data advantages
- Brand/community
- Regulatory barriers
- Tech + distribution combo

---

### 🏰 Example: Memora's Moat Strategy

**1. Data Network Effect**
- More users = better AI event detection
- Training data gets better over time
- New competitors start from zero

**2. Trust & Brand in Sensitive Space**
- Digital death is deeply personal
- First-mover advantage in trust
- Hard to switch once set up

**3. Integration Partnerships**
- Estate lawyers referring clients
- Exclusive partnerships with platforms

**4. Technical Complexity**
- AI + Blockchain + Legal compliance
- Not just code, it's orchestration

*Investors want to know: Why you? Why not the next team?*

---

### 🛡️ Identifying Your Moat

**Ask Yourself:**
- What gets better as you grow?
- What would take a competitor 12+ months to match?
- What can't be easily copied?
- What unique access/data/relationships do you have?

*If your only answer is "we're first," you don't have a moat yet.*

---

## 4️⃣ Assemble the Right Team

### Hackathon team ≠ Startup team

| Hackathon Team | Startup Team |
|----------------|--------------|
| Friends who can code fast | Complementary skills |
| Skills: shipping under pressure | Skills: building for years |
| Timeline: 48 hours | Timeline: 3-5+ years |

---

### 👥 What Investors Look For

**Technical Co-founder**
- Can build and scale the product
- Deep understanding of the tech stack

**Business/Growth Co-founder**
- Can sell and acquire users
- Understands the market

**Domain Expert** (Critical for some startups)
- Deep knowledge of the industry
- Network and credibility

---

### 🔧 Team Red Flags vs Green Flags

**Red Flags:**
- ❌ All technical, no one can sell
- ❌ Solo founder unwilling to share equity
- ❌ Team members half-committed
- ❌ Skill overlaps, no complementary strengths

**Green Flags:**
- ✅ Mix of technical + business
- ✅ Prior startup experience
- ✅ Full-time commitment
- ✅ Clear role divisions
- ✅ Shared vision, aligned incentives

*Investors bet on TEAMS more than ideas*

---

## 🔥 Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Building Too Much Before Selling**
   - Get users from week 1, iterate based on real feedback

2. **Focusing on Fundraising Too Early**
   - Build traction first, fundraise second

3. **Ignoring Unit Economics**
   - If CAC > LTV, you have a problem no funding can fix

4. **Underestimating Legal/Compliance**
   - Budget time and money for this, especially in regulated spaces

5. **Team Conflict on Vision**
   - Align early, document equity and roles clearly

---

## 💎 Key Takeaways

| Priority | What It Means |
|----------|---------------|
| **Validation > Celebration** | Hackathon win is just the start |
| **Users > Judges** | Real people paying matters most |
| **Traction > Technology** | Show growth, not just code |
| **Team > Solo** | Complementary co-founders are critical |
| **Business Model > Cool Idea** | Know how you'll make money |

*The hardest work starts AFTER the hackathon*
