### Need Idea Bank? We Even Got You Covered!

**Idea Bank to Inspire Your Next Project**

This idea bank is designed to help spark inspiration and provide direction for teams aiming to build scalable, sustainable, and impact-driven dApps on Lisk.

Browse a range of build-ready ideas inspired by real-world challenges faced by users, developers, and founders across the Web3 and local ecosystems.

**Note**: This list is just a starting point. If you're passionate about a different idea, go for it! The best projects often come from personal insight or local experience.

**Key Focus Areas:**
- Stablecoins & Localized Payments
- Consumer Apps
- DeFi & Financial Inclusion
- Others (Non-Exhaustive)

**Past Hackathon Winners:**
Need more inspiration? Check out a shortlist of past hackathon winners - proof that great ideas can come from anywhere.

**Guiding Principles:**

When deciding what to build, keep these in mind:
1. Solve a real-world problem or fill a clear market gap
2. Build venture-ready — strong tech + a clear, sustainable business model
3. Align with the Lisk ecosystem and focus areas
4. Commit to launching on Lisk Mainnet

**Ask yourself:**
- What real-world problem am I solving? Who experiences it?
- Is there a clear user or customer for this dApp?
- Is the market size and potential significant enough?
- How will the project generate revenue or sustain itself?
- Why does it make sense to build this on a blockchain?
- What makes my solution 10x better than the status quo?
- How will I attract and retain users?

**Additional Consideration:**
- Not every project needs a token. Only consider including it in your business if you can justify clear utility of your token and how it reinforces long-term growth.
