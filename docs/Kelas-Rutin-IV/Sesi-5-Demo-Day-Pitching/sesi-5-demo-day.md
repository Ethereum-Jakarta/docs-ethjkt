---

### **During the Pitch**

**Delivery Techniques:**

**1. Presence:**
- **Posture**: Stand/sit up straight (confidence!)
- **Eye Contact**: Look at judges (not just at screen)
- **Gestures**: Natural hand movements (don't be stiff)
- **Smile**: Show enthusiasm for your project

**2. Voice:**
- **Pace**: Speak clearly, not too fast (nerves make people rush)
- **Emphasis**: Stress key words ("This is GASLESS")
- **Pauses**: Let important points sink in (silence is OK!)
- **Energy**: Show passion (avoid monotone)

**3. Managing Nerves:**
- **Breathe**: Deep breath before starting
- **First 30s scripted**: Memorize opening (builds momentum)
- **Focus on message**: Not perfection
- **It's OK to be nervous**: Judges understand!

---

**Slide Delivery Tips:**

**Slide 1 (Cover):**
> "Good morning! We're Team [Name], and we built [Project Name] - [tagline]."

**Slide 2 (Purpose):**
> "We [WHAT you do] because [WHY it matters]."
> Example: "We built a virtual garden game where players truly own their plants as NFTs, because gaming assets should belong to players, not platforms."

**Slide 3 (Problem):**
> "Here's the problem we're solving: [User pain point with story]."
> Example: "Meet Sarah, a casual gamer who spent $500 on in-game items, only to lose access when the game shut down. This happens to millions of gamers every year."

**Slide 4 (Solution):**
> "Our solution is [UVP]. Here's how it works: [Core mechanism]."
> Example: "Players buy seeds with crypto, grow them into valuable plants, and harvest for rewards - all stored as NFTs they truly own forever."

**Slides 5-6 (Demo):**
> "Let me show you how it works. [Open live URL, walk through]"
> **DEMO TIPS:**
> - Have app pre-loaded (don't wait for page to load during pitch!)
> - Zoom in browser (larger text visible to judges)
> - Narrate what you're doing: "I'm connecting my wallet... now buying a seed... here's the gasless transaction..."
> - Highlight key UX: "Notice there's no gas fee popup - totally gasless!"

**Slide 7 (Why Now):**
> "Why now? [Market shift, tech readiness, behavior change]."
> Example: "Web3 gaming is exploding - $5B market growing 20% YoY. Infrastructure like gasless transactions makes it accessible to mainstream users."

**Slide 8 (Market):**
> "The market opportunity is significant: [TAM/SAM/SOM with numbers]."
> Keep it brief, don't dwell on numbers (judges can read slide)

**Slide 9 (Tech Stack):**
> "We built this with [key tech]. Smart contracts on Lisk, frontend in Next.js, and integrated Panna SDK for gasless UX."
> Show architecture diagram (don't explain every detail - they can see!)

**Slide 10 (Business Model):**
> "We make money through [revenue streams]."
> Example: "3% marketplace fee on plant trades, plus premium seed sales."

**Slide 11 (Team):**
> "Our team: [Names + roles]. We combined blockchain development, frontend skills, and design expertise."
> Briefly highlight relevant experience if impressive (ex: "our smart contract dev previously built X")

**Slide 12 (Vision/Ask):**
> "Our vision is [bigger picture]. We're excited to [next steps]."
> Example: "We envision a future where all gaming assets are player-owned. Next, we'll expand to multiplayer features and mobile app."

**Closing:**
> "That's [Project Name]. Thank you! Happy to answer any questions."

### **Handling Q&A**

**Types of Questions & How to Answer:**

**Technical Questions:**
> "How did you implement gasless transactions?"
- **Answer**: "We integrated Panna SDK which handles Account Abstraction. Users sign transactions with their wallet, but our paymaster sponsors the gas fees."
- **Tip**: Be specific but concise. Don't go into unnecessary technical depth unless asked.

**Business Questions:**
> "How will you acquire users?"
- **Answer**: "We'll start with Web3 gaming communities on Discord and Twitter, then partner with gaming guilds for distribution."
- **Tip**: Show you've thought about GTM, even if not fully executed.

**Design Questions:**
> "Why did you choose this onboarding flow?"
- **Answer**: "We wanted to minimize friction for non-crypto users, so we explain seed phrase backup with simple language and visual guides."
- **Tip**: Cite Web3 UX principles (from Sesi 4 design session).

**Competitive Questions:**
> "How is this different from [competitor]?"
- **Answer**: "Unlike [competitor], we focus on [unique aspect]. We also offer [differentiation]."
- **Tip**: Respect competitors, but clearly articulate your edge.

**"I Don't Know" Questions:**
> "What's your plan for regulatory compliance in Indonesia?"
- **Answer (if unsure)**: "That's a great question. We haven't fully researched Indonesian crypto gaming regulations yet, but it's definitely on our roadmap before mainnet launch. We'd love advice on resources for this."
- **Tip**: Honesty is OK! Show willingness to learn.

---

**Q&A Best Practices:**
- ✅ **Listen carefully** to full question (don't interrupt)
- ✅ **Pause before answering** (collect thoughts, 2-3 sec is fine)
- ✅ **Answer the question asked** (don't dodge)
- ✅ **Be concise** (30-60 seconds max per answer)
- ✅ **Involve team** (if teammate has better answer, defer: "Let me pass this to [name], our designer")
- ✅ **Stay positive** (don't be defensive if question implies criticism)

- ❌ **Don't ramble** (long answers lose judges)
- ❌ **Don't be defensive** ("That's actually not a problem because...")
- ❌ **Don't fake answers** (judges can tell)
- ❌ **Don't argue** (even if you disagree, stay respectful)

---

### **Demo Best Practices**

**Preparation:**

**Have Multiple Backup Plans:**
1. **Plan A**: Live demo (ideal)
2. **Plan B**: Pre-recorded video (if internet fails)
3. **Plan C**: Screenshots with narration (if video won't play)

**Demo Setup:**
- Open app in browser BEFORE your turn
- Have account pre-loaded with test data (don't start empty!)
- Pre-connect wallet (don't waste time connecting during demo)
- Bookmark your deployed URL (easy access)

**During Demo:**

**Narrate Everything:**
> Bad: *silently clicks through app*
> Good: "Here I'm clicking 'Buy Seed'... notice there's no MetaMask popup asking for gas - the transaction is gasless... and now my plant NFT appears in my garden."

**Show, Don't Tell:**
- Actually perform actions (click, type, submit)
- Show state changes (balance updates, NFT appears)
- Highlight gasless UX (no gas popups!)
- Show key differentiators

**Keep it Short:**
- Demo should be 60-90 seconds max
- Show ONE complete user journey (happy path)
- Don't try to show every feature (focus on core value)

**Handle Errors Gracefully:**
- If something breaks: "Ah, looks like we have a loading issue. Let me show the backup video instead."
- Don't panic or apologize excessively
- Move on quickly

**Example Demo Script (60 seconds):**
```
"Let me show you how it works. [Open app]

I'm already connected with my wallet - notice at the top, I have 0.5 test ETH and 2 plants.

I'll click 'Buy Seed' to plant a new one. [Click]

Here I select a seed type - let's go with Sunflower. [Select]

Normally, this would cost gas fees, but watch - [Click Confirm]

No MetaMask popup! The transaction is submitted gaslessly via Panna SDK. [Wait 2 sec for confirmation]

And there it is - my new plant appears as an NFT in my garden. [Point to new plant]

Over time, I can water it, watch it grow through 4 stages, and harvest for rewards.

[Optional: Quickly show another feature like 'Water Plant']

That's the core experience - simple, fun, and zero gas fees."
```

## 🚨 **Common Pitfalls to Avoid**

### **Presentation:**
- ❌ **Going over time** (practice timing!)
- ❌ **Reading slides word-for-word** (use as prompts, not script)
- ❌ **Too much text on slides** (visuals > bullets)
- ❌ **Skipping the demo** (judges want to SEE it work)
- ❌ **Apologizing for incompleteness** ("Sorry, we didn't finish X" - focus on what you DID build!)

### **Demo:**
- ❌ **Showing bugs** (if you know something is broken, skip it or use backup video)
- ❌ **Slow loading** (pre-load everything!)
- ❌ **Fumbling around** (practice demo flow)
- ❌ **Technical jargon during demo** (narrate in user-friendly language)

### **Q&A:**
- ❌ **Long-winded answers** (judges' eyes glaze over)
- ❌ **Defensive attitude** (stay humble & open)
- ❌ **Blaming team members** ("We would've done X but [teammate] didn't...")
- ❌ **Making promises you can't keep** ("We'll launch next month" when you have no resources)

### **Content:**
- ❌ **Unclear problem** (if judges don't understand the pain point, they won't care about your solution)
- ❌ **No differentiation** (why not just use existing solution?)
- ❌ **Unrealistic market size** (don't claim "trillion dollar TAM" without basis)
- ❌ **Ignoring business model** (how will this sustain?)
